## 📄 Description

This website is designed to provide a complete information about my current programming skills, inlcuding the entire skillset and technologies I'm planning to learn in the near future along with a additional contact information. Additionally it became a combination of the experiences I gained through all the previous web develoment. Likewise it might be adjusted in the future in the course of time ✨.

It is also one of the final projects from my programming course - Youcode 🏆.

### React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
